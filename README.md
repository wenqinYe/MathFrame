MathFrame
=========
## Getting Started
To get started all you have to do is instantiate an object of the MathFrameWork class, so you can use the MathFrameWork class' methods.
Example: `MathFrameWork *instanceOfMathFrameWork = [MathFrameWork alloc]init];`
You can now use the instance methods and class methods in the MathFrameWork class.

## Methods
### Fibonacci
Simply invoke the Fibonacci method (0 based, so to find first Fibonacci number, you would type index 0):
`[mathFrameWorkInstance calculateFibNumberAtIndex:<index you wish to calculate fib number to>];`

### Factoral
Invoke the factoral method:
`[mathInstance factoral:<factoral number to calculate>];`
